Computer graphics now provide a much easier way of visualizing curves constructed by solving initial value problems for differential equations, making both the geometric theory and its application to practical problems accessible to a wider audience of scientists and engineers. Recent studies in a wide range of disciplines, including mechanical vibrations, fluid dynamics, electrical engineering, and meteorology, have shown that chaotic attractors are common and typical behavior in real dynamical systems. Complete understanding of a dissipative dynamical system begins with constructing the phase portrait, i.e., a geometric phase space picture of any and all attractors, their basins of attraction, and the phase foliation of basins.}
