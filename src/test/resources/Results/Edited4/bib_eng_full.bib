  Abstract               = {{\textcopyright} 2016 In the present work the lock-in range of PLL-based circuits with proportionally-integrating filter and sinusoidal phase-detector characteristics are studied. Considered circuits have sinusoidal phase detector characteristics. Analytical approach based on the methods of phase plane analysis is applied to estimate the lock-in ranges of the circuits under consideration. Obtained analytical results are compared with simulation results.},

  Abstract               = {{\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.Nonlinear analysis of the phase-locked loop (PLL) based circuits is a challenging task, thus in modern engineering literature simplified mathematical models and simulation are widely used for their study. In this work the limitations of numerical approach is discussed and it is shown that, e.g. hidden oscillations may not be found by simulation. Corresponding examples in SPICE and MatLab, which may lead to wrong conclusions concerning the operability of PLL-based circuits, are presented.},

  Abstract               = {This paper proposes a modified canonical Chua's circuit using an one-stage op-amp-based negative impedance converter and an anti-parallel diode pair. Unlike the conventional Chua's circuit, this modified canonical Chua's circuit has one unstable zero node-focus and two stable nonzero node-foci, but complex dynamical behaviors including period, chaos, stable point, and coexisting bifurcation modes are numerically revealed and experimentally verified. Up to six kinds of coexisting multiple attractors, i.e., left-right limit cycles, left-right chaotic spiral attractors and left-right point attractors, are numerically depicted and physically captured. Furthermore, with dimensionless Chua's equations, dynamical properties of the Chua's system are investigated, and two symmetric stable nonzero node-foci are validated to exist in the selected parameter regions thus resulting in the emergence of multistability. Specially, multistability with six different steady states is revealed in a narrow parameter range. Within this parameter region, three bifurcation routes are displayed under different initial conditions, and three sets of topologically different and disconnected attractors are observed.},

  Abstract               = {{\textcopyright} 2017 In this paper we discuss the application of the harmonic balance method for the global analysis of the classical phase-locked loop (PLL) circuit. The harmonic balance is non rigorous method, which is widely used for the computation of periodic solutions and the checking of global stability. The proof of the absence of periodic solutions is a key step to establish the global stability of PLL and estimate the pull-in range (which is an interval of the frequency deviations such that any solution tends to one of the equilibria). The advantages and limitations of the study of the classical PLL with lead-lag filter using the harmonic balance method is discussed.},

  Abstract               = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V. During recent years it has been shown that hidden oscillations, whose basin of attraction does not overlap with small neighborhoods of equilibria, may significantly complicate simulation of dynamical models, lead to unreliable results and wrong conclusions, and cause serious damage in drilling systems, aircrafts control systems, electromechanical systems, and other applications. This article provides a survey of various phase-locked loop based circuits (used in satellite navigation systems, optical, and digital communication), where such difficulties take place in MATLAB and SPICE. Considered examples can be used for testing other phase-locked loop based circuits and simulation tools, and motivate the development and application of rigorous analytical methods for the global analysis of phase-locked loop based circuits.},

Discovery of undesirable hidden oscillations , which cannot be found by simulation , in models of phase - locked loop (PLL) showed the importance of development and application of analytical methods for the analysis of such models . Approaches to a rigorous nonlinear analysis of analog PLL with multiplier phase detector (classical PLL) and linear filter are discussed . An effective analytical method for computation of multiplier / mixer phase - detector characteristics is proposed . For various waveforms of high - frequency signals , new classes of phase - detector characteristics are obtained , and dynamical model of PLL is constructed .},

  Abstract               = {The mathematical model of the pulses phase-locked loop (PLL) with a frequency-phase detector and a current pump, which is represented as a set of difference and transcendental equations and relies on the dynamics of the given deterministic system (in the general case, an arbitrary-order loop filter) described by an automation with a finite number of components and combined differential equations, is examined. An algorithm describing the operation of the in-lock indicator of the given PLL is proposed. The particular cases of the first- and second-order loop filters are discussed. PLL simulation is performed under transient conditions.},

The statistical characteristics of the error signal are analyzed in the linear approximation.},
